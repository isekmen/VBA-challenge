# VBA-challenge

## Instructions
Create a script that loops through each year of all the stocks and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

6. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Other Consideration
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.
